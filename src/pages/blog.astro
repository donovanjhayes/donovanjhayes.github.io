  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
  </BaseLayout>

  <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>
  <ul>
 {allPosts.map((post) => <BlogPost url={post.url} title={post.frontmatter.title} />)}
  </ul>

  <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
